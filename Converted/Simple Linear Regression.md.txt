> Type of [[Linear Regression]] that
approximates the relationship between
**two** quantitative variables using a
straight line.
# Formula
$y = β_0 +β_1x$ + ε

# Characteristics
SLR has two quantitative variables
- Independent Predictor: $x$
- Dependent Response: $y$

We assume the relationship between these
two can be approximated as a straight
line.

$β_0$ is the intercept, $β_1$ is the
slope
ε is the error (wiggle room). Expect ε
to equal 0 in this class.
### 4 Assumptions of a Simple Linear
Regression
1. Correctly specified (the linear model
makes sense)
2. Error Terms are independent of
observations
3. Errors are normally distributed
4. Errors have a variance of $σ^2$
(constant variance)

> DO NOT USE PREDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE
DATA RANGE.

JUST BECAUSE $y$ HAS A LINEAR
RELATIONSHIP TO $x$ DOES NOT MEAN $x$
CAUSES $y$
(correlation != causation)

## Estimating Parameters
$β_0$ and $β_1$ are unknown
parameters.
We use sample data to find estimates
$\hat{β}_0$ and $\hat{β}_1$ to produce
the [[Least Squares Line]].

For each data point the [[Residual]]
(ε) is calculated as:
$ε=y-\hat{y}$
