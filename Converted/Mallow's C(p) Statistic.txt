## Definition
Mallow's C(p) Statistic measures the
[[Statistical Bias||bias]] in the model
under consideration relative to the full
model
## Formula
$C(p) = n-(p+1)
\frac{MSE_{p}}{MSE_{full}} + (p+1)$
## Characteristics
For a model having $p$ independent
variables:
$C(p) \approx p+1 \rightarrow$ Good!
$C(p) >> p+1 \rightarrow$ High Bias
(Missing information)
$C(p)<<p+1\rightarrow$ Dangerously Low
Bias (Too Many variables)

> approximation is kind of up in the air

High bias means that you're missing an
important variable that is telling you a
lot about your info

Low Bias means that your betas are
messed up and hard to explain.

When reducing a model you want to
explain the smae amount of variance but
with less variables

Bad variables flush themselves out with
low beta
