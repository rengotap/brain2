## Definition
The total sum of squares, or TSS, is the
overall variation in a model's Y values.

## Formula
$TSS = âˆ‘(y-\bar{y})^2$

## Relational Formulas
$TSS = SSR + SSE$
## Characteristics
As [[SSR]] becomes more of TSS as the
$x$, $y$ connection becomes stronger.

All the info for TSS is in either
[[SSR]] or [[Sum of Squares of Errors
(SSE)||SSE]]
