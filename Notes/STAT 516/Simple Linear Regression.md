> Type of [[Linear Regression]] that approximates the relationship between **two** quantitative variables using a straight line.
# Formula
$y = β_0 +β_1x$ + ε

# Characteristics 
SLR has two quantitative variables
- Independent Predictor: $x$
- Dependent Response: $y$

$β_0$ is the intercept, $β_1$ is the slope
ε is the error (wiggle room). Expect ε to equal 0 in this class.
### 4 Assumptions of a Simple Linear Regression
1. Correctly specified (the linear model makes sense)
2. Error Terms are independent of observations
3. Errors are normally distributed
4. Errors have a variance of $σ^2$ (constant variance)

> DO NOT USE PREDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE DATA RANGE.

JUST BECAUSE $y$ HAS A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP TO $x$ DOES NOT MEAN $x$ CAUSES $y$
(correlation != causation)
