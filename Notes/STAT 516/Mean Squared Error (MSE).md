## Formula
$\frac{∑(y-\hat{y})^2}{n-2}$

$MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-m-1}$
m is the number of independent variables
## Characteristics
Despite being called the Mean Squared Error, it should really be the Mean Squared [[Residual]]
MSE is unbiased.

MSE is an estimation for $σ^2$
$\sqrt{MSE}$ is an estimate for $σ$
