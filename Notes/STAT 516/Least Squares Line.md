## Definition
The least squares line is the line chosen that minimizes the [[Sum of Squares of Errors (SSE)]]

## Formula
$\hat{y}=a+bx$
where
$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$
$a = \bar{y} - b(\bar{x})$
## How To Find
The most common way of finding the least squares line is by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
Typically, we have a computer do this for us.
