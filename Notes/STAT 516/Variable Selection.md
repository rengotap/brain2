A lot of possible [[Independent Variables]] are considered in a study.

## Goals
1. Choose a model that yields accurate estimates and predictions.
2. Choose a model that explains the variation in $y$.
3. Choose a parsimonious model. (The least amount of variables needed to achieve goals #1 and #2)

## Why Picking an Appropriate Number of Variables Matters
#### In A Model With Too Many Variables...
- By nature, a model with many variables has a lot of [[Multicollinearity]].
- Can't make inference about $Î²_{i}$. 
	*Even if you could, it wouldn't have any interpretability. Imagine trying to explain to a boardroom how thirty different variables are related*
#### In A Model Too Few Variables...
- $y$ might not be as accurate due to missing information.
