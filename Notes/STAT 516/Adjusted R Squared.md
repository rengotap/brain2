Like [[R Squared]] but it punishes you every time you add a variable.
## Formula
$r^2_a = (r^2 - \frac{p}{n-1}) (\frac{n-1}{n-p-1})$
also
$r^2_a =1-\frac{\frac{SSE}{n-p-1}}{\frac{TSS}{m-1}}$
also
$r^2_a= 1- (\frac{n-1}{n-1-p})(\frac{SSE}{TSS})$
## Characteristics 
If your variable is good enough, the benefit of its addition will outweigh the penalty of its addition
