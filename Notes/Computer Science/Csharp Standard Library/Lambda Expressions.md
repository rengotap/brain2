## Definition

A lambda expression is an anonymous function. They are similar to [[Methods]] but do not require names and can be implemented in the body of a method.

Use `=>` to define them.

Expression lambda
```C#
(parameters) => expression
```

Statement lambda
```C#
(parameters) => {sequence of statements}
```
