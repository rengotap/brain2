## Test Types

#### Unit Testing
[[Unit Testing]] tests lone methods or functions in an isolated environment.
#### Integration Testing
[[Integration Testing]] tests if smaller units can work together as a single piece of software. This may involve integrating external services.
#### System Testing
[[System Testing]] tests the whole system environment in which the software will run
#### Performance Testing
[[Performance Testing]] tests the runtime performance of a piece of software, i.e. how fast it runs.
#### Load Testing
[[Load Testing]] tests how many requests a piece of software can handle simultaneously while maintaining the required performance.
#### User Acceptance Testing
[[User Acceptance Testing]] tests to see if users can successfully use a piece of software.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development is a development theory stating that developers should write unit tests before they write functional code, and that a unit should pass all tests before moving on to the next one.
