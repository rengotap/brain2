## Definition
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 

They have an intent, a motivation, and a structure.

## The Three Types of Design Patterns

#### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns are object creation mechanisms that increase the flexibility and reusability of code.

>The creational patterns are: [[Singleton Pattern||Singleton]], [[Builder Pattern||Builder]], [[Factory Pattern|| Factory]], [[Abstract Factory Pattern||Abstract Factory}]], and [[Prototype Pattern||Prototype]].
#### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns explain how to combine objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

> The structural patterns are: [[Adapter Pattern||Adapter]], [[Bridge Pattern||Bridge]], [[Composite Pattern||Composite]], [[Decorator Pattern||Decorator]], [[Facade Pattern||FaÃ§ade]], [[Flyweight Pattern||Flyweight]], and [[Proxy Pattern||Proxy]].
#### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns describe how to distribute responsibilities between objects and how to maintain effective communication between them.

> The behavioral Patterns are: [[Chain of Responsibility Pattern||Chain of Responsibility]], [[Command Pattern||Command]], [[Iterator Pattern||Iterator]], [[Mediator Pattern||Mediator]], [[Memento Pattern||Memento]], [[Observer Pattern||Observer]], [[State Pattern||State]], [[Strategy Pattern||Strategy]]. [[Template Pattern||Template]], and [[Visitor Pattern||Visitor]]
## Design Pattern vs Algorithm
Picture a birthday party. You probably imagine things like balloons, a cake, presents, and candles. There is no *definitive* way to have a birthday party, but most of them follow a standard-ish layout. The idea of a birthday party is the equivalent of a Design Pattern.

On the other hand, consider a cake recipe. You can change the recipe slightly depending on the situation (like gluten free flour or lactose free milk), but the end result will always be almost exactly the same. When following a cake recipe, there is a *definitive* way of doing things.
The cake recipe is the equivalent of an algorithm
