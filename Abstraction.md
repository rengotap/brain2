## Definition
Unlike [[Inheritance (Classes)]], abstraction captures the core idea of an [[Object]] but ignores the details or specifics.

> Note that this page is about the concept of abstraction and not the keyword [[Abstract]].

If a class is not abstract then it is considered **concrete**. Only concrete classes can be used to create objects. Abstract classes can not be instantiated as they can not be considered a "complete" product on their own.
