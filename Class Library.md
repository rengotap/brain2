## Definition
A class library groups types together into easily deployable units (shipped as .dll files).

> Code designed to be reused across multiple projects should be put into class libraries.
## Characteristics

Class libraries created by the .NET 8 SDK can only be referenced by other .NET compatible assemblies. It may be worth changing to a lower  SDK using a current compiler to maximize portability.
